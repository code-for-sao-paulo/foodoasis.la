This is the live website for foodoasis.la.

The files in this repository are generated by Jekyll from the source files in the [site](https://github.com/foodoasisla/site) repository.

## Here are steps you can follow to update the files…

1. Clone the [https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasis.la](https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasis.la) respository into a folder called `_site`.

2. Move that `_site` folder into your local [https://github.com/foodoasisla/site](https://github.com/foodoasisla/site) repository, replacing the `_site` folder that’s already there, if it exists. (That's right! You can put a repository inside of a repository. It’s like Inception!)

3. Switch to your local [https://github.com/foodoasisla/site](https://github.com/foodoasisla/site) repository and run `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve`.

4. Switch to your local [https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasis.la](https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasis.la) repository. Commit and push the new files.

Your changes should now be visible at: https://foodoasis.la
