# Food Oasis

This is a website with list of resources about food deserts and health. You can view the site here…
https://foodoasisla.github.io

## How to make changes to the site

The site is published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and the website files are generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

### Step 1: Install Jekyll

To use Jekyll, you’ll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Once you have Ruby installed, you can install Jekyll from your terminal with this command…

```
gem install jekyll
```

### Step 2: Make your changes to the source code

a. Clone the `site` repository… [github.com/foodoasisla/site](https://github.com/foodoasisla/site)

b. Make your changes

c. Commit and push your changes

### Step 3: Generate the site with Jekyll

Run this command within your project folder…

```
jekyll build
```

Or, if you want to preview the site on your machine…

```
jekyll serve
```

And then visit… [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Step 4: Publish

When you generate the site, Jekyll creates a folder called `_site` within your project folder.

To publish your changes…

a. Clone the [foodoasisla.github.io](https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasisla.github.io) respository.

b. Overwrite those files with the contents of your `_site` folder.

c. Commit and push your changes.

OPTIONAL: You can also clone the [foodoasisla.github.io](https://github.com/foodoasisla/foodoasisla.github.io) respository to your `_site` folder to save a step… [See step 11 in this Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28249255/how-do-i-configure-github-to-use-non-supported-jekyll-site-plugins?rq=1#answer-28252200).
